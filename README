Using the titanic travellers dataset, the objective is to predict which passengers survived the tragedy, and which ones did not.

This is a Binary Classification problem

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

Initially, few models were tried including: RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoosting(Sklearn), XGBClassifier etc. But none of them gave a good score. So, the code in this repository makes use of Keras' Sequential Model with linear stack of layers. 



From the initial data set given, these features doesn't really have an impact on prediction, and so, can be removed:
    > Passenger name
    > Passenger ID
    > Ticket Number or Details
    > Cabin (out of 891 training sets, 687 are missing - also, this doesn't have a big impact on prediction)
